This application demonstrates how to subscribe to a data topic over bristlemouth via the bm_sub function.
The application subscribes to the topic "pubsub_example" and prints the received message to the console.
The callback function subscribe_callback is called when a message is received.
To test this application, you will need to run the pub_example application on another node.
